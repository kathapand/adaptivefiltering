It is intended for audiences without programming backgrounds that still would like to work with the `adaptivefiltering` library. It is by no means a good introduction into programming with Python or Jupyter itself, as it only explains those parts necessary to work with `adaptivefiltering`."

This is different from *compiled* languages, where the source code is translated into an executable program before running. In a normal setting, one would often invoke the Python interpreter manually with a `.py` file to interpret that Python file's content."

When doing so, Jupyter will send the code in the cell to the Python interpreter, which will execute it and send any results back to Jupyter which may then display that information to us in the web interface. We can repeat this process with other code cells. Note that we do not necessarily have to execute code cells in a Jupyter notebook top to bottom - although it makes sense most of the time."

Libraries are either released as part of the Python [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) or provided by third parties e.g. through the Python Package Index [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). If installed, a library is *imported* into a Python project using the `import` statement. We will typically import the `adaptivefiltering` library at the beginning of our notebooks:"
